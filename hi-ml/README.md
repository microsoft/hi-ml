# Microsoft Health Intelligence Machine Learning Toolbox

## Overview

This toolbox aims at providing high-level building blocks for Machine Learning / AI researchers and
practitioners. It helps to simplify and streamline work on deep learning models for healthcare and life sciences,
by providing tested components (data loaders, pre-processing), deep learning models, and cloud integration tools.

This toolbox is still in very early stages, and presently offers only the cloud integration components. ML components
will be added in the next few weeks.

## Getting started

* Install from `pypi` via `pip`, by running `pip install hi-ml`


## Issues
If you've found a bug in the code, please check the [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/hi-ml/issues) page. 
If no existing issue exists, please open a new one. Be sure to include 
- A descriptive title
- Expected behaviour (including a code sample if possible)
- Actual behavior


## Contributing
We welcome all contributions that help us achieve our aim of speeding up ML/AI research in health and life sciences.
Examples of contributions are
* Data loaders for specific health & life sciences data
* Network architectures and components for deep learning models
* Tools to analyze and/or visualize data
* ...

Please check the [detailed page about contributions](docs/source/contributing.md).
