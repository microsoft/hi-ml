# Histopathology Models and Workflows

## Getting started

### Setting up Python

For working on the histopathology folder, please create a separate Conda environment.

```shell
cd hi-ml-histopathology
make env
```

You can then activate the environment via `conda activate HimlHisto`. Set VSCode to use this Conda environment, by choosing "Python: Select Interpreter"
from the command palette.

### Setting up AzureML

In addition, please download an AzureML workspace configuration file for the workspace that you wish to use:

* In the browser, navigate to the workspace in question
* Click on the drop-down menu on upper right of the page, to the left of your account picture.
* Select "Download config file".
* Save that file into the the repository root.

Once that config file is in place, all Python runs that you start inside the `hi-ml-histopathology` folder will automatically use this config file.

## Running histopathology models

To test your setup, please execute in the `hi-ml-histopathology` folder:

```shell
conda activate HimlHisto
python ../hi-ml/src/health_ml/runner.py --model histopathology.TcgaCrckImageNetMIL  --cluster=training-nd24
```

This should start an AzureML job in the AzureML workspace that you configured above via `config.json`. You may need to adjust the name of
the compute cluster (`training-nd24` in the above example).

### Conda environment

If you start your jobs in the `hi-ml-histopathology` folder, they will automatically pick up the Conda environment file that is present in that folder.
If you start your jobs in a different folder, you need to add the `--additional_env_files` option to point to the file `<repo_root>/hi-ml-histopathology/environment.yml`.

## Running histopathology tests

In the `hi-ml-histopathology` folder, run

```shell
make call_pytest
```

Inside of VSCode, all tests in the repository should be picked up automatically. You can exclude the tests for the `hi-ml` and `hi-ml-azure` packages by
modifying `python.testing.pytestArgs` in the VSCode `.vscode/settings.json` file.
