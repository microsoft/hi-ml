Documentation for the Health Intelligence Machine Learning toolbox hi-ml
========================================================================

This toolbox helps to simplify and streamline work on deep learning models for healthcare and life sciences,
by providing tested components (data loaders, pre-processing), deep learning models, and cloud integration tools.

The `hi-ml` toolbox provides

- Functionality to easily run Python code in Azure Machine Learning services
- Low-level and high-level building blocks for Machine Learning / AI researchers and practitioners.
