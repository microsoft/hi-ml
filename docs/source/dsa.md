# Digital Slide Archive

The [Digital Slide Archive][1] (DSA) is "a containerized web-based platform for the analysis, visualization, management and
annotation of whole-slide digital pathology imaging data".
It is an open-source project based on [Kitware][11]'s data management platform [Girder][10].

## Azure deployment

We have deployed the DSA on [Azure][2] to visualize our data and interpret our models and experiments.
Below are instructions to replicate our deployment using your own data.

### Host

The first step is [creating a Linux virtual machine][4] (VM) to host the DSA.
The code can be [downloaded from GitHub][5] and run using [Docker][6].
By default, the application runs at port 8080.
To use HTTPS, an SSL certificate must be obtained and port 443 may be specified instead within the Docker configuration.
The DSA uses [Cherrypy][8] as the underlying server engine.
Therefore, Cherrypy must be [configured][9] to use the SSL certificate installed in the VM.
Ports in a VM can be opened using [network security group rules][7].

### Storage

The datasets we use are securely stored in [Azure Blob Storage][3] containers.
Containers can be mounted on the host machine using [BlobFuse][13] and connected to Girder using [assetstores][12].

### Authentication

We have [added][14] Microsoft as a provider in the [OAuth2 Login][15] plugin for Girder.
An app must be [registered][16] so that [Azure Active Directory][17] (Azure AD) can be used for authentication.

### Authorization

User [permissions][18] can be set to different data collections in an assetstore, to maximize protection of sensitive data.

## Visualizing Azure Machine Learning results

The [Girder RESTful API][19] may be used to upload annotations to DSA items programmatically.
An example of a use case is creating annotations to visualize attention maps generated by a deep learning model.
The `girder` module in this repository includes tools to download training results from Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) and
upload annotations to a deployed DSA.
For example:

```shell
SCRIPT="hi-ml-histopathology/src/histopathology/utils/girder.py"
python $SCRIPT --run-id Experiment_transformer_Gleason_run_0 --rescale
```

This script uses the [Azure SDK][20] and the [Python client for the Girder API][21] to:

1. Log into Azure ML
2. Download training results
3. Generate JSON annotations for each slide
4. Upload the annotations to the deployed DSA
