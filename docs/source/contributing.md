# Contributing to this toolbox

We welcome all contributions that help us achieve our aim of speeding up ML/AI research in health and life sciences.
Examples of contributions are
* Data loaders for specific health & life sciences data
* Network architectures and components for deep learning models
* Tools to analyze and/or visualize data

All contributions to the toolbox need to come with unit tests, and will be reviewed when a Pull Request (PR) is started.
If in doubt, reach out to the core `hi-ml` team before starting your work.

Please look through the existing folder structure to find a good home for your contribution.

## Submitting a Pull Request
If you'd like to submit a PR to the codebase, please ensure you:
- Include a brief description
- Link to an issue, if relevant
- Write unit tests for the code - see below for details.
- Add appropriate documentation for any new code that you introduce

## Code style

- We use `flake8` as a linter, and `mypy` for static typechecking. Both tools run as part of the PR build, and must run
without errors for a contribution to be accepted. `mypy` requires that all functions and methods carry type annotations,
see [mypy documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#function-signatures-and-dynamic-vs-static-typing).
- We highly recommend to run both tools _before_ pushing the latest changes to a PR. If you have `make` installed, you
can run both tools in one go via `make check` (from the repository root folder)
- Code should use sphinx-style comments like this:
```python
from typing import List, Optional
def foo(bar: int) -> Optional[List]:
    """
    Creates a list. Or not. Note that there must a be blank line after the summary.
    
    :param bar: The length of the list. If 0, returns None. If there is a very long doc string for an argument, the next
        line must be indented.
    :return: A list with `bar` elements.
    """
```
Note the blank line after the summary, and the indentation of multi-line documentation for parameters.

## Unit testing
- DO write unit tests for each new function or class that you add.
- DO extend unit tests for existing functions or classes if you change their core behaviour.
- DO try your best to write unit tests that are fast. Very often, this can be done by reducing data size to a minimum.
Also, it is helpful to avoid long-running integration tests, but try to test at the level of the smallest involved
function.
- DO ensure that your tests are designed in a way that they can pass on the local machine, even if they are relying on
specific cloud features. If required, use `unittest.mock` to simulate the cloud features, and hence enable the 
tests to run successfully on your local machine. 
- DO run all unit tests on your dev machine before submitting your changes. The test suite is designed to pass 
completely also outside of cloud builds.
- DO NOT rely only on the test builds in the cloud (i.e., run test locally before submitting). 
Cloud builds trigger AzureML runs on GPU machines that have a far higher CO2 footprint than your dev machine.
