# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

For each Pull Request, the affected code parts should be briefly described and added here in the "Upcoming" section.
Once a release is prepared, the "Upcoming" section becomes the release changelog, and a new empty "Upcoming" should be
created.
